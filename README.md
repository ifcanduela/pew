 > An amateur PHP framework.

Pew-Pew-Pew is a PHP 5.4 framework for simple websites.

I've used this for all my latest personal projects and it's usable -- although a little bit unreliable -- I break things on a weekly basis. Use at your own risk or, better yet, don't use at all.

# Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/ifcanduela/pew-app
    $ cd pew-app
    $ composer install
    $ php -S localhost:8000
